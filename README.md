===============

Online BRL-CAD Geometry Viewer is a tool to view BRL-CAD's 
native CAD (.g format) file on browser. ThreeJS (webGL) is used at 
backend to visualize geometry. The project is developed exclusively 
to facilitate BRL-CAD users to view and share their models.

Currently in initial stage, the project expected to have more 
advanced features in near future.
