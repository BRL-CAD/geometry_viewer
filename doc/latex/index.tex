Online B\-R\-L-\/\-C\-A\-D Geometry Viewer is a tool to view B\-R\-L-\/\-C\-A\-D's native C\-A\-D (.g format) file on browser. Three\-J\-S (web\-G\-L) is used at backend to visualize geometry. The project is developed exclusively to facilitate B\-R\-L-\/\-C\-A\-D users to view and share their models.

Currently in initial stage, the project expected to have more advanced features in near future.
